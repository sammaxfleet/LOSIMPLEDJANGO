# Design

The website design easy to navigate. The less is more approach is to mirror the architecture of the villa & create a resemeblance to its ambiance. The colour scheme was chosen to create a relaxing & calm experience for the user like it should be when you're on a break.
The design has a lot of images, allowing the user to get as close of a visual representation of what it's like to be there. 

# Colour Scheme

<img width="1427" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-29 at 19 48 05" src="https://github.com/sammaxfleet/LOSIMPLEDJANGO/assets/114914739/7b954a5e-626f-48d3-9698-90c47647c7a5">

I chose these colours to give a peacful feel to the site, the blue represents the ocean & while the orange the sun, the snow white the architecture & the Burgandy matching the interior of the villas. 

# Fonts 

font-family: Clarendon LT, Lulo Clean, Georgia;

I used this font to give more of a mediteranean touch to the page, something that would be good for a resturant menu but I have flipped it and used it for the booking a Villa. 



# WireFrames

## DATABASE DIAGRAM

For this Django app I’ve used PostgreSQL relational database management system.

The Sample diagram was use using https://lucidchart.com, it shows how I interconnected everything. 
The table shows the structure of the PostgreSQL database, including tables, columns, relationships stored in the database.

# BASE HTML & CSS WEBSITE LAYOUT.

## Title

<img width="455" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-06 at 17 24 23" src="https://github.com/sammaxfleet/LOSIMPLEDJANGO/assets/114914739/b54a3db7-0084-4214-832f-7b290134d102">

"Lo Simple" translates "The Simple" in Spanish.
I chose the Burgandy font against the snow white background. I think the colour is calm and inviting. 



## Nav Bar

The Nav is the first time we see the orange on the site. This colour brings a warmth and a is a colour we associate with holiday. 

<img width="532" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-06 at 17 24 33" src="https://github.com/sammaxfleet/LOSIMPLEDJANGO/assets/114914739/d859d8e2-4884-40c5-ba2d-806024219eca">

The next Img show's the babyblue highlight when switching page or navigating between seleciton like here on the "My Account" option.

## Footer

I have got 3 social media icons in the footer, the colours are customized to match the sites aesthetic.
<img width="190" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-06 at 17 41 37" src="https://github.com/sammaxfleet/LOSIMPLEDJANGO/assets/114914739/75340b3b-7579-488d-819b-cab09cdddc28">



## Imagery

The images on the site mainly consists of the architecture, I personally feel this is the main appeal as well as the location for the user. 
On the images page you can then zoom into the image to see them all.
The images give a warm & slick vision to the site. The appeal is very minimal, a less is more approach with the interioir and architectual design from the villas.
I have posted screen shots beaneath this in the page walkthrough. 



#  Web Pages Walkthrough 

## Home Page

The complimetary colours on the home page, I believe draw the user in the first feature is a mirrored image. 
The first image is of the villa's architecture. This shows the spacious ambiance & captures its relaxing touch with its colours. 
![Screenshot 2023-07-06 at 18 25 09](https://github.com/sammaxfleet/LOSIMPLEDJANGO/assets/114914739/975f7e08-15f9-4fab-8e5b-906eb38a1df2)


I took down the opacity to be creative with the first feature of the site, the images ditto each other. 

Post the feature Image, in a smaller container class I added some of the Villa interior - This is not to give the user the full features yet, but to keep the user engaged by showing some of the best roooms of the villa. 
The continuity for the viewer is important seeing the beautiful architecture is great, the next feature I felt was important to show the inside of the villa, to spark the thought of the user staying there. 
<img width="816" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 10 46 30" src="https://github.com/sammaxfleet/LOSIMPLEDJANGO/assets/114914739/59e42889-fc08-4e01-932b-0f132b1afa95">



2nd section of the page- 
Location is imperative for anyone on a vacation. The map show's the location and gives a link to google maps, next to it there are some links to the user gaining further info about the page, which direct you either to the "About Page" or "Book Page".

## Book & Success Page. 

The Booking option, there are 4 villas available for booking. This page you are able to scroll through the description and see the aesthetic of Apartment 1.
The book button lights up blue before it navigates the user to the next page. The page is desigend for the user to easily navigate throught the booking process, the text is kept in black and the buttons grey here with it being a financial booking so it's more of a formal process for the user & no nright colours are throwing off the user.
