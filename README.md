# Design

The website design easy to navigate. The less is more approach is to mirror the architecture of the villa & create a resemeblance to its ambiance. The colour scheme was chosen to create a relaxing & calm experience for the user like it should be when you're on a break.
The design has a lot of images, allowing the user to get as close of a visual representation of what it's like to be there.

# Fonts 

The 'Quicksand' font is the main font used on the page, while 'Montserrat' in a bolder weight was used for the navbar and 'Kanit' for other accent areas. The 'Sans-serif' font is noted as a backup and will be used in the event that the main fonts aren't imported correctly to the site. These font style were chosen for their ease of legibility and general letter spacing and were imported from Google Fonts.
